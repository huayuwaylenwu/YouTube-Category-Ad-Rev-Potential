# YouTube Video Performance & Advertising Revenue Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing the most popular YouTube videos (as of early 2022) to simulate how YouTube might optimize advertising revenue. The goal was to identify patterns in video performance and assess potential drivers of ad value. This project was completed as part of my Business Analytics coursework at Portland State University.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Jupyter/IPython, PyCharm, pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- **Excel** (for preliminary exploration and basic visualization)

## Key Tasks & Contributions
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis** to evaluate video performance and advertising potential.
- Cleaned and transformed a **large raw dataset** into a usable format using Python and Excel.
- Created **data visualizations** in both Python and Excel to clearly communicate trends and insights.
- Imported and manipulated various data types in Python to support comprehensive analysis and business recommendations.
