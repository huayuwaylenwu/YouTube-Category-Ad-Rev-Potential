The data is also structured and organized in rows and column with category headings, and can be easily laid out in a spreadsheet. The form is tabular.\n\nThis dataset has statistics up-to-date of the top trending videos on the YouTube platform in the US from August of 2020 to March of 2022. It updates daily to include the trendiest videos defined by how viral, or how quickly it geneartes a large audience online. Some statistical categories that measure video popularity in numerical values include the number of likes and comments the videos received from their viewers. The categorical variables include video category and it identifies the type of content of the videos. \n\nPlease note these statistics were reflected on the dates when they were first trending, not as of today.

By finding \nout out the most popular categories, we can run ad campaigns for top content creators from those categories. As for the categories that are not as strong, we will focus less on advertising for those videos at the moment and find ways to increase their popularity.\n\nThe outcome variable will be most_popular, second_popular, and third_popular.The most_popular variable will define the number one most popular video category, the second_popular variable will define the second most popular category, and the third_popular variable will define the third most popular category. Popularity is defined by how quickly the videos could generate view count once they are published on YouTube.\n\nHaving these three variables will allow me to discover the view count of the three most popular categories. I plan to calculate the average views of videos in the categories and compare them. The top three highest view counts will be the most popular categories.\n\nOn the other hand, we will have least_popular, second_least_popular, and third_least popular. They will help me define the least popular categories.\n\nThere will be two models. The first model is view count mean v.s median. The variables are video category, mean view_count and median_view count. I will compare the mean view count of categories to the median view count of categories. \n\nThe second model is the average view count. I will add the mean and median view count of each category and divide them by two.

To do that, we created a pivot table that lists those statistics and a bar chart that reflects the table.\n\nBased on the table, the medians and means of videos across all categories are worlds apart from each other.

Nonetheless, average content creators do not have that ability. For them, they need to put in more effort to engage their audiene. Turning on the comment section is a crucial way to do that.

As mentioned before, we need both averages to capture the whole story. \n\nFrom the figures above, the top three ratings(please refer to first bar chart above) proceed in the following order respectively: **music, entertainment, gaming**. As for the bottom three ratings, they proceed in the following order respectively: **travel & events, sports, autos & vehicles**.\n\nNow that we have the results, we could assign them to the outcome variables we defined earlier:\n* most_engaging = music\n* 2nd_engaging = entertainment\n* 3rd_engaging = gaming\n\n* least_engaging = travel & events\n* second_least_engaging =  sports\n* third_least_engagin = autos & vehicles\n\n**In conlcusion, the top three most engaging video categories are music, entertainment, and gaming.

In order to maximize the revenue, we need to target the types of videos that will have the potential for having the most advertisements watched. To discover such videos, we have analyzed the view count, like count, and comment count of different types of videos. \n\nTo begin, my first finding has to do with identifying the top three and bottom three video categories ranked in terms of popularity. To measure the popularity, I averaged the view count of all the trendiest videos when they were first released in every video category. The results I gathered reflected music, entertainment, and science & technology as the most popular, respectively. The latter two are close to each other, while music has a big gap that separates itself form the two as being the most popular. On the other hand, the three least populuar categories are pets & animals, autos & vehicles, and howto & style, in that order. \n\nMoving on to my next finding, I analyzed if disabling the comment section will affect the popularity and likability of videos. To measure the popularity, I averaged the view count of all the trendeist videos when they were first released labeled as two types of videos; they are videos with comments disabled and those without comments disabled. I calculated the average number of like count per 100 view count of these two types of videos to measure the likability. I discovered that disabling the comment increases a video's popularity by a very small amount that virtually has no effect on its ability to generate advertisement revenue. On the other hand, videos that disabled their comments are less likable than videos than videos with comments not disabled. \n\nNext, I conducted analysis on how disabling the ratings will affect the popularity and engagement of videos. Popularity is measured by averaging the view count of all trendiest videos labeled in two types of videos: ones with ratings disabled and ones without ratings disabled. On the other hand, engagement is measured by calculating the average comment count per 1000 view count of all trendiest videos labeled in the two types of videos aforementioned. My findings say that videos with ratings disabled are more popular than videos with ratings not disabled. On the other hand, videos that disabled their ratings are significantly less engaging than videos with comments not disabled. \n\nFinally, for my last finding, I identified the top three and bottom three categories of video categories ranked in terms of engagement. To measure the engagement, I averaged the comment count of all the trendiest videos in every video category. The results I gathered reflected music, entertainment, and gaming as the three most engaging categories, respectively. Music, as a category, is ranked miles ahead in terms of engagemeent compared to even the latter two categories in the top three aforementioned. On the other hand, travel & events, sports, and autos & vehicles are ranked the least popular in that respect. \n\nThere are a lot of recommendations that we could derive from these results. I think there are two key conclusions we could make. Firstly, we should definitely focus our advertising effort on music videos. They are by far the most popular and engaging categories. Popularity will catpure the videos more views, multiplying the amount of advertisements that will be watched. Engagement captures the viewers' interest, so that they will stay longer and are more likely to watch the full length of the advertisements. With these two factors combined, we will generate a lot more advertising revenue if our advertising strategies are working on music videos. Secondly, we shall continue granting content creators the option of disabling their comment section and ratings. For the comment disabling, it barely affects the popularity of videos. Although disabling comment will affect the likability, there are certain controversial topics that are unavoidable to some content creators. Moreover, some content creators would like to stay away from a potentially controversial group of people commenting on their videos. Moreover, the likability is not affected by a substantial degree that it will seriously impact our finacial health. We should also care about our creators' well being. As for ratings, although disabling them will make videos more popular, not disabling them will make videos significantly more engaging, on the other hand. This should even out the field. For that reason, we should keep the option to allow content creators to disable their ratings. Again, they might have valid reasaons to do so, and we care about our creators! Without them, we would not be able to generate advertising revenue. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Project comparison:**\n\nThere are many comparisons and contrasts I could make between the 350 and this project. I could tell you from off the top of my head that both are fun, although this one is more fun thanks to how creative you can get with the codes. It also feels a lot morer satisfying when you solve a coding error that got you stuck for a good time. \n\nTo begin, I would like to say 350 project is a more theoretical. You are thinking more from the business perspective more and are more concered with the big picture(at least for me). Analyzing the data was more subjective, as I had no coding experience and could not think of it from a more technical perspective. Analyzing in Excel is slightly more easier for me as you could generate bar charts and tables form just clicking a few icons on the Excel menu. In terms of cleaning the data, I find both ways to be equally simple. Anyways, going back to the big picture, it is not that I did not think from an eagle's eye in this project, it is just that I felt so much more attracted to the details. Perhaps I have already visualzied the big picture in 350, so that became automatic to me. For 350, I was concerened about little details too, but more on the biases and human errors and such. \n\nI am surprised that this project actually took me shorter to complete than the 350 project. This seems like a much more complicated project. But then, again, I carreid over the knowledge from 350. Moreover, datacamp has been my friend. It provided me a template for coding all the models. I admit I used a lot of copy and pasting. However, what programmers do not do that? In this day of age, we rely on Googling so much, especially programmers. There are so many communities that can help them and provide them with codes to be pasted. I was iniitally guilty of pasting the codes, but learned what needs to be done needs to be done. \n\nAnyways, I love this project, and the 350 one too! I honestly think these are the most two useful classes in the entire BTA program(although I haven't taken privacy yet). Thye teach me to think from both a big picture and detail-oriented perspective. More importantly, it is fun and rewarding. \n","metadata":{}}]}
